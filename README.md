## Curbing German Drug Misuse

Of the 8,238 overdose deaths in the European Union in 2017, 13% of those cases came in Germany alone. And, from 2012-2020, the number of German overdose deaths has increased year-over-year in every year except 2017. With this in mind, our group used data from the German population to try to determine if we could predict drug misuse as a preventative measure. Two of the questions of interest that we aimed to find answers to included: is there a particular mental illness that is correlated with drug use or vice versa, and is there a prescription drug that when used legally is correlated with drug misuse. We also aimed to see if the region in Germany made a difference in cases of misuse, that is if some regions are hit harder by illicit drug use. 

Our findings of mental illnesses as correlated with drug misuse were astounding. There are some findings with regard to ASD (autism spectrum disorder), in that people with an ASD diagnosis have around a 10% chance of having misused fentanyl, stimulants, or buprenorphine. But the most astonishing result that we found was that across all 13 disorders measured (including anxiety, depression, OCD, and others), there was around a 20% chance that a person diagnosed with a mental illness had misused codeine. This stood out from any other drug, which usually had a 0-10% chance of being misused given a person who has a mental disorder.

For people who were taking drugs as prescribed, we found that a person's probability of misusing any of the 14 drugs was very high if they had been prescribed sufentanil (38%), hydromorphone (36.5%), or tapentadol (33%). 

Interesting enough, codeine was at the bottom of this list, which means that a person who takes codeine as prescribed is least likely to misuse drugs as compared to any of the other drugs. This, taken into account with the prior information, may mean that doctors are more likely to prescribe codeine to patients with mental illness because they feel it is less likely to be a gateway drug, and as a result this drug is more readily available to patients.

In terms of location, illicit drug use is more prevalent in the western half of Germany. Drugs that are GABA analogues were seen more in the east of the country. However, we found the location of a person to be less of a concrete indicator of illicit drug use.
